### INTRODUCTION

1. VANET aims to ensure safe driving by improving the traffic flow and therefore significantly reducing car accidents. This is possible by providing appropriate information to the driver or to the vehicle.
2. Due to the  difficulties of using a real time execution due to authentication and privacy issues, several majors are taken to provide the wireless network for smart trafficking to minimise the  causes of accidents . 
3. VANETs can increase road safety by sharing information about both vehicles (e.g., position, speed and direction) and traffic conditions (e.g., accidents, jams, aquaplaning) as beacons.
4. Safety messages, in this case, are the key information to avoid accidents. However, collisions can occur when safety messages and transmission of packets are improperly broadcast from multiple vehicles
Many threats for VANET.

### AUTHENTICATION AND PRIVACY
Although the excitement surrounding the potential benefits of VANETs is growing, the dynamic nature of VANETs (vehicles can join and leave at will) along with a multitude of system and application related requirements make it very challenging to design efficient methods for ensuring privacy of vehicles.

### MODEL
The implementation of the Model starts with the verification of the data provided by the user such as the details like phone number, address, car number,personal details of the users is all first verified then stored in the database .All this data is provided or accessible -only to the Trusted Authority . In the whole process only this section is the only one where we are providing the details of the User.
